The data was gathered using EvaSys and the original file format was *.sav*, after anonymizing the data is now provided as *.csv* files. Additionally, the column labels are provided as a *.csv* file. The folder *questionnaires* contains PDFs of the questionaires used per term. The folder *R* contains the R script used to anonymize the data as well as the R script used to generate the codebooks.

## Removed data

From each data set the following questions were removed:

  - Question 2.4: Which lecture(s) did you attend?
  - Question 4.3: What other experiences did you make using lecture recordings?
  - Question 5.8: What were other reasons for using the lecture recording instead of attending the lecture?
  - Question 6.2: Which other role did the lecture recordings have in your learning process?
  - Question 7.8: What were your technical problems?
  - Question 8.2: What else would you like to tell us? (Suggestions, requests, praise and critique, etc.)
  - Question 9.2: What were other reasons for not using the lecture recordings?

These questions were removed from the data sets to make it impossible to identify which lecture series the respondents were refering to. In the questionnaires the list of recorded lecture series has been blacked out. This has been done to protect the lecturers privacy.
